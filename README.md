The webportal is to create a graphic to show support for the #HFSWAgainstTobacco #NoTobacco #TobaccoExposed campaign organised by Hibiscus Foundation of Social Welfare with World Health Organisation (WHO)

Tobacco is a highly addictive stimulant used predominantly in the preparation of cigarettes, cigars and similar products. This is particularly detrimental to human health. About 8 million people die each year as a result of tobacco abuse. With the latest media promotion and visibility, even children are at risk of becoming addicted. 
HFSW has taken up this mission, along with the WHO, to combat and raise awareness among the general public over the ill effects of tobacco and other related products.

Hibiscus Foundation for social welfare (HFSW) is a Non-for-profit, Non-partisan organisation working primarily on mental health but also on other areas such as women and child empowerment, and universal healthcare. 
We call on the contributors to join us on this war against tobacco.
